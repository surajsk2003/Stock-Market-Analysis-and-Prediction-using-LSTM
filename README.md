# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction using LSTM
## About
This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks built with the Keras Python package to predict stock market prices and analyze time series data. The model is designed to forecast future stock prices based on historical price data.

## The project includes the following:

Stock Market Data Prediction: Predicting future stock prices from historical data.
Time Series Forecasting: Using LSTM to predict the sequential nature of stock prices over time.
The LSTM model is capable of handling complex patterns in stock market data and can be applied to a variety of stock prediction tasks.

## Usage

Prepare the Data:

Use historical stock data in .csv format (such as Yahoo Finance data) for training the model.
Preprocess the data by normalizing and reshaping it into a format suitable for LSTM input.
Train the Model:

Run the main.py script to train the LSTM model on the stock market data.
The model uses the past stock prices to predict future stock prices.
Evaluate the Model:

After training, the model's predictions are compared against actual stock prices to evaluate its accuracy.
Visualization:

Matplotlib is used to visualize the predicted and actual stock prices over time.

## Example Output
Sine Wave Sequential Prediction:
The model's ability to predict a simple sine wave sequence to demonstrate sequential time series prediction.
